# Bilcode Frontend

This repository contains the frontend application for Bilcode, built with React and Vite. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and GSAP for animations.

## Technologies Used

*   **React 19**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A robust JavaScript animation library.
*   **ESLint**: For code linting.

## Getting Started
